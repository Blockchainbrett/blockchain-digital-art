Is cryptokities art? Kinda, its really a game but aspects of it are art.. ex:someone wanting to hold and display a cryptokitty
What if you had a digital puppy that you could grow, teach it tricks, train him, ...Kinda a game. but,
a giphy of that happening with the puppy in the photo having that capability as through a smart contract would be art?
or maybe the dog itself would be worth more than a tradeable item and more of a priceless pet


upon receiving the token of ownership for a digital art it uses create2 to let you only do things a certain amount of times
like you can add a characteristic, only 10 people can ever decrypt the file (would be nuts if could prove the artist giving up 
files for certain), etc
